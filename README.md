# pathout-shapes

Path-**insensitive** CodeXM checkers, one per defect *shape*, for examining
the functions on which Coverity applied its per-function path bound
(`PATHOUT`). They extend the analyzer rather than second-guess it: each one
is run over a whole intermediate directory in seconds, and its hits are kept
only inside the functions where the corresponding path-sensitive checker
reached the bound, because everywhere else that checker finished and its
verdict stands. The procedure, the filter and the execution-based
confirmation step live in the
[`coverity-pathout` skill](https://github.com/edtice-goog/CoveritySkills/tree/master/coverity-pathout);
this repository is only the checkers.

## Why the bound, and why look past it now

Static analyzers come in two families. Sound tools exhaust the state space
and prove their results; they are excellent on small programs and do not
scale. Coverity's family bounds the work it will spend on any one function
and reaches detection rates close to the sound tools on codebases those
tools cannot analyze at all. That bound is the engineering decision that
made whole-program analysis of large systems practical, and the `PATHOUT`
line in the log is the analyzer recording, per function and per checker,
exactly where it applied it. Nothing is hidden and nothing is skipped
silently.

For twenty years the residue behind the bound was an acceptable trade,
because finding it and chaining it into an exploit took scarce expert
attention. Frontier models have removed that scarcity. The bound is still
the right design; what changed is that the corners it leaves are now worth
lighting, and the analyzer's own artefacts -- the log, the intermediate
directory, the derived models -- make lighting them cheap. These checkers
are the first step of that: a higher detection rate at early-stage cost,
instead of a late-stage tool pulled forward into a budget it does not fit.

| checker | shape | stands in for | relevant components for the filter |
|---|---|---|---|
| `null_check_then_deref` | a pointer null-tested somewhere in the function and dereferenced where no test of it guards (an `if`, a ternary, a loop condition, `&&`/`\|\|`, or an exit guard whose body returns, jumps, or calls a function that never returns: `exit`, `abort`, an expanded `assert`) | FORWARD_NULL, REVERSE_INULL, NULL_RETURNS | `FORWARD_NULL`, `NULL_RETURNS` (`REVERSE_INULL` as a second pass) |
| `zero_check_then_divide` | an integer tested against zero and used as a divisor where no test guards | DIVIDE_BY_ZERO | `DIVIDE_BY_ZERO` |
| `double_free` | the same variable passed to a releasing call at two sites in one function | USE_AFTER_FREE (double free) | `USE_AFTER_FREE` |
| `unbounded_copy_into_fixed_buffer` | a fixed-size local array receives `strcpy`/`strcat`/`sprintf`/`gets` | STRING_OVERFLOW, OVERRUN | `STRING_OVERFLOW`, `OVERRUN` |
| `alloc_never_released` | a local receives an allocator's result and is never freed, passed, returned or stored | RESOURCE_LEAK (the leaks-on-every-path subset) | `RESOURCE_LEAK` |
| `unchecked_null_return_deref` | a local receives a may-return-null call (`malloc`, `fopen`, `getenv`, `strchr`, ...), is dereferenced, and is never null-tested in the function | NULL_RETURNS | `NULL_RETURNS`, `FORWARD_NULL` |
| `source_length_into_fixed_buffer` | `strncpy`/`memcpy`/`strncat` into a fixed-size local array, bounded by `strlen(src)` or by a variable that receives it and is never compared (the shape behind CVE-2025-0282) | STRING_OVERFLOW, OVERRUN | `STRING_OVERFLOW`, `OVERRUN`, `BUFFER_SIZE` |
| `unchecked_array_index` | a fixed-size local array indexed by a variable never compared in the function | OVERRUN, NEGATIVE_RETURNS | `OVERRUN`, `NEGATIVE_RETURNS`, `TAINTED_SCALAR` |
| `unbounded_arithmetic_into_sink` | `+ - * <<` (or `+= -= *= <<=`) on a variable never compared in the function reaches an allocation size, a memory routine's length, or an array index, directly or through a never-compared variable (supersedes `overflow_before_alloc`) | INTEGER_OVERFLOW, OVERFLOW_BEFORE_WIDEN | `INTEGER_OVERFLOW`, `OVERFLOW_BEFORE_WIDEN`, `TAINTED_SCALAR` |
| `narrowing_cast_of_arithmetic` | such arithmetic cast, explicitly or implicitly, to an integer type with fewer bits (same width with different signedness is not reported) | INTEGER_OVERFLOW (cast_overflow / cast_underflow) | `INTEGER_OVERFLOW`, `OVERFLOW_BEFORE_WIDEN` |
| `free_of_nonheap` | `free` of `&x`, a local array, a string literal, or `p + n` | BAD_FREE | `BAD_FREE`, `USE_AFTER_FREE` |
| `nonliteral_format_string` | a `printf`-family call whose format is not a literal and which passes nothing after it | PRINTF_ARGS, FORMAT_STRING_INJECTION | `PRINTF_ARGS`, `FORMAT_STRING_INJECTION`, `TAINTED_STRING` |
| `sizeof_pointer_as_size` | `sizeof` of a pointer variable as the size of `memset`/`memcpy`/`malloc`/... | SIZEOF_MISMATCH, BAD_SIZEOF | `SIZEOF_MISMATCH`, `BAD_SIZEOF` |

## Running

When a later stage (a fuzzer, a pen test, a customer) has found a defect
whose function pathed out, run the one checker for its shape:

```bash
cov-analyze --dir <idir-copy> --disable-default --codexm checkers/<shape>.cxm
cov-format-errors --dir <idir-copy> --json-output-v10 candidates.json
```

When only a PATHOUT is known and no defect yet, every shape is a
hypothesis; run them all in one pass:

```bash
bin/run_all.sh <install>/bin <idir-copy> [outdir]      # -> <outdir>/candidates.json, count per checker
```

It refuses an idir that already has an `output/` (the original
`analysis-log.txt` is what the skill reads first) unless `IN_PLACE=1`. Then
filter to PATHOUT functions with the skill's `tools/pathout_filter.py`,
passing the last column of the table as `--relevant` for each checker's
hits.

`bin/run_fixtures.sh <install>/bin` compiles `fixtures/` and checks each
checker against the `HIT` markers in them.

## What they cannot do, on purpose

No order (CodeXM's `sourceloc` has no fields and `happens-before` is only
valid inside the path-sensitive `sequence()`), no value tracking, no
feasibility, no reassignment. The checkers that need order (use after
free, uninitialized read, lock without unlock) are not here for that reason;
their order-blind approximations were too noisy to be worth a filter.

## Provenance

Every checker was developed against a fixture (`fixtures/shapes.c`,
`fixtures/shapes2.c`, `fixtures/null_check_then_deref.c`), and the first
five were run over the subversion 1.14 + sqlite idir in tool-interop; the
whole catalogue was run over lua, zstd, nginx and redis idirs (counts in
the skill's `CALIBRATION.md`). `source_length_into_fixed_buffer` is the
shape of CVE-2025-0282 (a bounded copy whose bound is the source's own
length). Nothing here came from customer code.

One CodeXM trap is worth stating here because it silently disabled parts
of three of these checkers until 2026-09-10: `exists a in X where P ||
exists b in Y where Q` parses as ONE `exists` with the second nested in the
first's `where`, so an empty X makes the whole disjunction false.
Parenthesize every `exists` in an `||` chain.
